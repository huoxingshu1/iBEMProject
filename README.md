# iBEMProject

Welcome to iBEM software package which is developed to solve a large numnber scale of particle-enforced composite materials.

## Theoretical part of the algorithm 

please refer to our newly published book - inclusion based boundary element methods.

## Create a run:

1. git clone the code into your visual studio and open the solution.

2. make sure the eigen external dependency is set up.

3. prepare for your inputs ( a set of txt files) and put them in the same folder of your code. For each type of the problem, we provide an example input under /examples/\<problem type\>/..

4. For debug, please use the debug mode, or ultilize multi thread running, please switch to release mode to run.
